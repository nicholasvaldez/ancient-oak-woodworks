            Meet Tyler Anderson
          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Tyler Anderson founded Ancient Oak Woodworks with a simple mission: to create furniture that tells a story and lasts for generations. His meticulous attention to detail and unwavering dedication to the craft shine through in every piece he creates.
          </p>
          <p class="font-body text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Every piece is meticulously handcrafted using traditional techniques combined with modern precision. Working from his garage workshop while balancing a full-time job, Tyler pours his heart into each creation. Supported by his wife Ana and their beloved bunny Giuseppe, his Christian faith drives him to infuse every piece with genuine love and care, honoring the natural beauty of wood through patient, detailed craftsmanship.
